âœ¨ I am an Aspiring Software Developer, and I am just about to finish my Bootcamp in Software Engineering. âœ¨

A few months ago I saw a tutorial that demonstrated how to get your web browser to write out things from a simple txt file. This is where I fell in love with coding. From that moment I could not get coding out of my mind and found myself researching what else we can do with code. I explored the basics of HTML and CSS, then started to self-study Python from YouTube channels and several websites/free online courses.
Being fascinated by the endless possibilities that lies in coding, I enrolled to HyperionDevâ€™s bootcamp in Software Engineering to gain my first (but definitely not the last) qualification in in the field.
